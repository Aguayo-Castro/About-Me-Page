            I'm an undergraduate at CSUSB, I have been programming 
            for about 2 years. The languages I know the best are C++,
            python, and Java. I hope to go into video game development,
            but I am open to anything. What I love about programming is 
            being able to do it anywhere with a computer, as opposed to having
            to learn everything in a lab or some testing grounds. I prefer
            the comfort of my room.
